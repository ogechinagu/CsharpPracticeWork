# C# Practice Project - Arithmetic, Conditional Statements, and Loops

## Overview

This repository contains my first C# console practice during the course of my training at the Sterling Academy Backend Engineering bootcamp. I solved 16 simple arithmetic, conditional statement, and loop problems. Through this project, I gained a solid understanding of C# basics, including handling user input, performing arithmetic operations, and utilizing conditional statements and loops effectively.

## Problems Solved

1) Write a program that divides a number entered by the user by 2
2) Write a program that will multiply any two number and display the result
3) Write a program that will ask the user to enter any two and display the division result.
4) Write a program that will find the exponential of two number and display the result.
5) Write a program that displays the multiplication table 6.
6) Write a program that displays any times table the user requests.
7) Write a program to ask the user what 24+9 is. Say “Excellent” if they get it right.
8) Write a program to ask the user “how many in a bakers dozen?” and say “most excellent” if they get it right.
9) Write a program to ask the user to enter their age. If their age is under 18 then say “Sorry, this film is not for you”.
10) Write a program to ask the user for two numbers. Compare the first with the second and then print out one of three messages. Either the numbers are equal, the first is bigger, or the second is bigger. You will need more than one IF to solve this one.
11) Write a program which asks the user to enter their password. If they enter the word “PASSWORD” then display the message “Welcome to the treasure”, otherwise display a message which says “go away, it’s all mine”.
12) Write a program which asks the user to enter a number between 1 and 10. If the number entered is out with this range then display a message “Sorry…out of range”.
13) Write a program that asks for 5 numbers, calculates the mean average and then rounds it down. Display the result on screen.
14) Write a program that checks a username against a stored value. How the user enters the username should NOT be case sensitive.
15) Adapt program 1 so that it also takes in a password. If the user enters spaces after the password the computer will trim them out automatically.
16) Write a program that will check a phone number is of the correct length.

## How to Run the Program

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the CsharpPracticeWork.sln solution file in your preferred C# development environment.
3. Build the solution and run the program.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the various problems and see the results.

## Learning Resources

During the development of this project, I referred to various online resources and tutorials to learn C# basics. Some of the most helpful resources were:

- [Official Microsoft C# Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)
- [C# Fundamentals for Absolute Beginners by Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/course.aspx?cid=10525)
- [C# Programming Yellow Book by Rob Miles](https://www.csharpcourse.com/)

Feel free to check out the code and provide any feedback or suggestions. 

## Appreciation

Many thanks to my tutor, Lawrence Peters, Sterling Bank and InstinctHub, I hope to learn amazing stuff and translate my learning real solutions that would be of value to users. #React2FullStack 📚💻🚀
